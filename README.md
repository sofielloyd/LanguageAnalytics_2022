# Language Analytics - Spring 2022 

## Portfolio description
This repository contains all of the code and data related to my portfolio exam in the Spring 2022 module **Language Analytics** which is a part of my tilvalg in Cultural Data Science at Aarhus University.  

The language analytics portfolio consists of 5 projects; 4 class assignments + 1 self-assigned.

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on regularly until **30th may 2022**.  


## Usage (reproducing results)
Every folder in this repository is structred with the following folders; ```input```, ```output```, ```src```, ```utils```, and a README.md which gives a further description of the assignment.  

The ```input``` folders are empty and this is where you should uploade your own data, if you want to reproduce the code. The input data that I have used for the given code is described in the specific assignmentfolder.

The ```output``` folders contains my results and it is this folder that you should 
*Include some instructions for how a user can engage with your code and reproduce/replicate your results. This includes installing dependencies from a requirements.txt, and how to run the script from the command line (including extra arguments, etc).*  

The coding part of this repository will be run on Python.  


## Discussion of results
