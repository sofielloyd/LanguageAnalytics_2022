# Sentiment and NER - Assignment 2
This repository contains all of the code and data related to the second assignment for my portfolio exam in the Spring 2022 module **Language Analytics** which is a part of my tilvalg in Cultural Data Science at Aarhus University.  

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on regularly from now and until **30th may 2022**.

## Assignment description 
Write a small Python program to perform NER and sentiment analysis. Using the corpus of Fake vs Real news, write some code which does the following
- Split the data into two datasets - one of Fake news and one of Real news
- For every headline
  - Get the sentiment scores
  - Find all mentions of geopolitical entites
  - Save a CSV which shows the text ID, the sentiment scores, and column showing all GPEs in that text
  - Find the 20 most common geopolitical entities mentioned across each dataset 
    - Plot the results as a bar charts

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate that I have a good understanding of how to perform dictionary-based sentiment analysis.

## Technicalities 
The coding part of this repository will be run in Python.
