# Collocation Tool - Assignment 1
This repository contains all of the code and data related to first assignment for my portfolio exam in the Spring 2022 module **Language Analytics** which is a part of my tilvalg in Cultural Data Science at Aarhus University.  

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on regularly from now and until **30th may 2022**.

## Assignment description 
write a small Python program to perform collocational analysis using the string processing and NLP tools you've already encountered. Your script should do the following:  
- Take a user-defined search term and a user-defined window size.
- Take one specific text which the user can define.
- Find all the context words which appear Â± the window size from the search term in that text.
- Calculate the mutual information score for each context word.
- Save the results as a CSV file with (at least) the following columns: the collocate term; how often it appears as a collocate; how often it appears in the text; the mutual information score.

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate that I have a good understanding of how to use simple text processing techniques to extract valuable information from text data.

## Technicalities 
The coding part of this repository will be run in Python. 

## Repo Structure
