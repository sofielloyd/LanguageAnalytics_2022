# Text Classification - Assignment 4
This repository contains all of the code and data related to fourth assignment for my portfolio exam in the Spring 2022 module **Language Analytics** which is a part of my tilvalg in Cultural Data Science at Aarhus University.  

This repository is in active development, with new material being pushed on regularly from now and until **30th may 2022**.

## Assignment description 
Write two ```.py``` scripts which do the following:

- The first script should perform benchmark classification using standard machine learning approaches
  - This means ```CountVectorizer()``` or ```TfidfVectorizer()```, ```LogisticRegression``` classifier
  - Save the results from the classification report to a text file 
  
- The second script should perform classification using the kind of deep learning methods we saw in class
  - Keras ```Embedding``` layer, Convolutional Neural Network
  - Save the classification report to a text file 

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to show that I can perform text classification using *both* classical machine learning approaches, as well as using more sophisticated 
deep learning approaches.

## Technicalities 
The coding part of this repository will be run on Python. 

## Repo Structure  
This repository has the following directory structure:  

| **Folder** | **Description** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ```input``` | Input data |
| ```output``` | Output data |
| ```src``` | Python scripts |
